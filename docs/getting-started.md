# Bookmarks Cards

Google Chrome extension that displays bookmarks into cards inside the new tab page. Bookmarks are read and displayed:

* First folder on the bookmarks is displayed horizontally on top and highlighted in yellow
* Rest of folders are displayed as rectangular cards
* Each bookmark is displayed with its icon and title, and it can be clicked to open the link
* The title of the card can be clicked to open all links in a new tab group
* Nested folders are displayed as collapsed cards that can be expanded by clicking on the âž• icon, or can be shown by clicking on the icons of the links
* The extension also shows the last 5 closed tabs in the section Recently Closed

This extension is built with React and TypeScript as a learning playground while providing a useful view for those of us dealing with many bookmarks.
