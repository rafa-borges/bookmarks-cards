# Bookmarks Cards
This is a Vue 2 JavaScript app that renders Chrome bookmarks into cards. It is meant to be used as Chrome extension.

## TODO List
- Change the UI component for + to a popup-like component
- Unit testing
- TypeScript support
- VueX or similar for the loading of the chrome data
- Migration to Vue3

## Project commands
```
yarn install
yarn serve
yarn build
yarn test:unit
yarn lint
```

## Running the app
- As a standalone app: run the ```serve``` command and open index.html - sample data is used for displaying cards
- Inside Chrome as an extension: [load the extension unpacked](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)
