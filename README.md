![build-test-deploy](https://github.com/rafa-borges/bookmarks-cards/workflows/build-test-deploy/badge.svg?branch=master)

This is a React TypeScript app that renders bookmarks into cards. It is meant to be used as Chrome extension. You can see a [live demo](https://rafa-borges.github.io/bookmarks-cards/).

## TODO List
- Visual adjustments
- Automated testing
- Break down to smaller components

## Project commands
```
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

## Running the app
- As a standalone app ```npm run dev``` and open index.html - sample data is used for displaying cards
- Inside Chrome as an extension: [load the extension unpacked](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)
